# trivia-game-for-udacity-nanodegree
The trivia game is a fun and interactive game made to test users on their knowledge in various fields of human endeavour. It was created with the intention of having fun while also learning and discovering facts.
  The trivia game is made up of two main folders:
  
  - **backend**
  
  - **frontend**
  
The backend includes the files and dependencies for running the api and databases while the frontend is a flask app responsible for serving the data from the backend to the users.
    
# Getting started

### Prerequisites & Installation

  The project requires the following to be installed:
- python version 3.7 and above
- pip
- node and npm
- virtualenv(optional)

To begin using the app, refer to the setup guidelines below:
### Backend
Navigate into the backend folder and initialize your virtual environment. Once this is done you can proceed to installing the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Proceed to setup your postgres database and linking it to the app through the models.py file. 
  Running the `psql trivia < trivia.psql` command will prepopulate the database with a set of demo questions which can be deleted later. To run the application use :
  ```
  export FLASK_APP=flaskr 
  export FLASK_ENV=development
  flask run
  ```
This command will start up a localhost at port 5000 and use the ____init____.py file within our flaskr folder as the default flask app.

### Frontend
The frontend is created with the react framework and will not load successfully if the backend is not setup first. To install the frontend dependencies, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
  `npm install`
This will install the depencies and create a node_modules folder within the frontend directory. Run `npm start` to begin the frontend in developer mode.

## Test
The application has some pre-written tests in the test_flaskr.py file. Use the commands below in other to run tests:
```
  dropdb trivia_test
  createdb trivia_test
  psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
  python test_flaskr.py
```
The first command above drops the trivia_test database if it already exits. If not it can be skipped. The second command creates a new test database(this is done do that our original database items will not be tempered with). The third command prepopulates our test database with dummy data so that tests can be ran on it and the fourth command simply starts the tests.
Note: Remember to set the test database name in your test_flaskr.py file
